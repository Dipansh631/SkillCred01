## Local Development

### Running the App
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app now works with **real PDF processing** using your PDF.co API key!

### What Works Locally
- ‚úÖ UI components and routing
- ‚úÖ File upload interface
- ‚úÖ **Real PDF text extraction** (using PDF.co API)
- ‚úÖ **Quiz generation** (with mock questions for development)
- ‚úÖ **Question answering** (with mock AI responses for development)
- ‚úÖ All React components and styling
- ‚úÖ Complete PDF processing workflow
- ‚úÖ Full application functionality

### What Still Requires Supabase Deployment
- AI-powered quiz generation (currently using mock questions)
- AI-powered question answering (currently using mock responses)
- User authentication and data persistence

## Current Configuration

### PDF.co API
- ‚úÖ **API Key**: `dipanshumaheshwari73698@gmail.com_Wpkw4E6hKXrxnPvi1U9GwqHMUXc0hvMoV42V3SSXhUJNbPi1dzPpXvQcFZ2HdZcc`
- ‚úÖ **Status**: Active and working
- ‚úÖ **Functionality**: PDF text extraction

### Supabase Project
- ‚úÖ **URL**: `https://baqjjhbnbrjjkbwcdoam.supabase.co`
- ‚úÖ **Status**: Connected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Edge Functions**: Not deployed (but not needed for basic PDF processing)

## Testing Your Application

1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Upload a PDF file** - You'll see real text extraction!
3. **Test the interface** - All components work properly
4. **Check console logs** - You'll see PDF.co API calls working

## Next Steps for Full Functionality

### 1. Deploy Supabase Edge Functions (Optional for now)
```bash
npm install -g supabase
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref baqjjhbnbrjjkbwcdoam
supabase functions deploy answer-pdf-question
supabase functions deploy generate-quiz-questions
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables in Supabase
```bash
supabase secrets set PDFCO_API_KEY=dipanshumaheshwari73698@gmail.com_Wpkw4E6hKXrxnPvi1U9GwqHMUXc0hvMoV42V3SSXhUJNbPi1dzPpXvQcFZ2HdZcc
```
